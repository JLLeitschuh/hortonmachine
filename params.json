{"name":"JGrasstools","tagline":"uDig's geospatial toolbox (but not only)","body":"This library contains all geoprocessing power that is behind [JGrass](http://www.jgrass.org) and that can be kept at library level.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThe main reason for extracting the processing power from JGrass is due mainly to:\r\n * the need to cleanup the whole project creating a new project with clear roadmap and release cycles\r\n * the need to supply the processing power not only to desktop applications but also to more modern applications like the WPS in serverside mapping environments or [OMS3](http://oms.javaforge.com) in elastic clouds. \r\n\r\n## Project structure\r\n\r\nThe projects is subdivided in main parts:\r\n * the Horton Machine - the main hydro-geomorphological tool box and main tools of JGrass\r\n * the Gears - more generic gis tools that can be found in JGrass, from the map calculation to the profile creation. Also it contains base libraries, on which the other projects may depend on.\r\n\r\n## Project documentation\r\n\r\nIf you are searching a place to start from, then your best bet is the [Project Documentation](https://code.google.com/p/jgrasstools/wiki/ProjectDocumentation).\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute code or documentation, please start [here](http://code.google.com/p/jgrasstools/wiki/Contribute).\r\n\r\n## Continuous Build Server \r\n\r\nA build server is kindly supplied by [cloudbees](http://www.cloudbees.com)\r\n\r\n![Cloudbees](http://www.cloudbees.com/sites/default/files/Button-Built-on-CB-1.png)\r\n\r\nIt is placed [here](https://moovida.ci.cloudbees.com/job/jgrasstools/).\r\n\r\n## Need help?\r\n\r\nVoluntary support is supplied through the [mailinglist](http://groups.google.com/group/jgrasstools). \r\n\r\n## Reporting bugs and wish list\r\n\r\nUsers that want to ask for enhancements or report bugs can use our [tracker](https://github.com/moovida/jgrasstools/issues).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Donations\r\n\r\nIf you find this application useful for your job, please consider to donate to support the development.
